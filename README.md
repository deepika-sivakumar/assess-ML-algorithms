# Assess Machine Learning Algorithms: 
**Description:** Implemented Decision Tree Learner, Random Forest Learner and Bootstrap Aggregating Learner for Regression problems (using feature selection methods) 
**Dataset:** To predict the returns for MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) index based on previous index returns
**Experiments & Results:** Bagging significantly reduced overfitting, but did not eliminate it altogether. Decision trees outperformed Random trees in terms of accuracy, whereas Random trees were better with computational time.
